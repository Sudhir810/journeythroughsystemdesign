# 🏗️ The System Design Journey (2026 Edition)

> "Mastering the city of System Design, one street at a time."

Hi! I'm Sudhir Taneja, an SDE with 8 years of experience. This repository is a living document of my deep dive into building scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap

I am following the path laid out in **"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"** (DDIA) by Martin Kleppmann, supplemented interview-style deep dives.

### Phase 1: Storage Engines

- [Simple Segment Files and Hash Index](./StorageEngines/StorageEngine.md)
- [SSTables and LSM Trees](./StorageEngines/ssTablesAndLSMTree.md)

## 📈 My Learning Strategy

| Step      | What I Do                                  | Why                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Read**  | Deep dive into a chapter or research paper | Build foundational understanding        |
| **Write** | Explain it to my "past self"               | Validate understanding through teaching |

## 🤝 Contributing

I'm learning in public! If you find a bug in my math, a typo in my notes, or have a better way to explain a concept:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/AmazingContribution
   ```
3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add your message here"
   ```
4. Push to the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/AmazingContribution
   ```
5. Open a Pull Request

## ⭐ Why Star This?

If you are also navigating the complex world of System Design, follow along! I'll be updating this weekly with fresh code and simplified notes that cut through the academic jargon.
